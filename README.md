Hello! :wave: I am Andrea López, a data-analyst currently working as an R&D researcher. This is my portfolio, I hope I don't abandon it before starting to fill it with projects! :upside_down_face:

The projects I want to upload will be...
* Related to developing data analysis skills: SQL, Excel 🔍
* Programming languages: Python, R 🧮
* Creating visual and self-explainatory dashboards 📊
* Overall practicing and mantaining skills so I don't get rusty 💪
* Maybe some weird tests trying things out! 💀
Let's hope this repo doesn't die! 🙏
